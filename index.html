					<p>This UX Engineer is best buds with QE</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>First, a little bit about me</p>

						<p>I'm a UX engineer, who loves helping people create accessible web products.</p>

						<p>And creator of Web Access Club, an accessibility podcast for web creators. Launching later this year.</p>

						<p>I've been in the NZ tech industry for about 8 years now, specialising in UI front-end work. Accessibility is an important part of my practice.</p>

						<p>I have a lot of experience working with exploratory testers. So I have a deep appreciation for that art of breaking my badly written code.</p> 
						
						<p>I do owe a significant part of my career to you detail oriented folks, bringing me all sorts of usabilty issues that the designers and I hadn't even thought possible. <span aria-hidden="true">[Next]</span></p>

					</div>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Over the last few years, I've been trying to convince people in different roles accross the business about importance of accessibility... and implementing accesssible experiences.</p>
						<p>When I speak to testers, that means a lot more things to test for. I get many different reactions... Most of them, are like this <span aria-hidden="true">[Next]</span></p>
						<p>Unimpressed, horrified by more work, no idea how to add it to their workflow</p>
						<p>I was disheartened at first...</p>
						<p>But what I realised... is that those reaction are caused by fear of the unknown.</p>
						<p>I mean, how many of us have dealt with people with disabilities on our daily lives?</p>
						<p>Sure, I know people who need glasses, struggle with contrast, has colourblindness... Those are the problems many of us can understand and solve without much convincing. It's using our eyes</p>
						<p>But how many people do I personally know, is someone who relies upon screen readers? None</p>
						<p>So of course it's unknown. Of course it's scary. You have no frame of reference. You keep deferring learning to use the tool.</p>
						<p>But it doesn't have to be that way</p> 
						<p>That is why I'm here, to show you how approachable it actually it. And quite useful <span aria-hidden="true">[Next]</span></p>

					<h2 id="slide4">What's a <br>screen reader?</h2>
					<p class="fragment">Assistive software that<br />reads digital content and interfaces</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>But! We need to understand what on earth is a screen reader??</p>

						<p>True to its name, it's an assistive technology, like my glasses.</p>
						
						<p><span aria-hidden="true">[Next]</span> It's a software that reads digital content and interfaces. It helps users who cannot look at the interface, for whatever reason, access other software and its content.</p>

						<p>I'm emphasising on <em>'software that lets you access other software'</em> here.</p>

						<p>As web creators, it's often easy to forget that assistive technologies aren't solely made for accessing the web.</p>

						<p>It's made so that users can access anything on their device. Installed apps and etc. Your web product just happen to be run on an app called a browser, something that assistive tool like screen reader could be used on.</p>

					<h2 id="slide5">Who use it?</h2>

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">Blind</li>

						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">Neurodiverse</li>
						
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">AI assistant</li>

						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4">Lazy ol' me</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>When I first learnt about screen readers, I thought only those who are completely blind uses it.</p>

						<p>When I heard the word 'blind', I immediately visualised people who use a guide dog or a stick to move around.</p>

						<p>Oh... how wrong I was. There are so many different access needs that is helped by screen readers. Here are a few that I'm aware of</p>

						<ol>
							<li>
								<p><span aria-hidden="true">[Next]</span>

								As I mentioned, many blind users use screen readers. But it's important to note that people can be 'blind' in different ways.</p> 
								
								<p>There <em>is</em> a spectrum!</p>
								
								<p>Some people are fully blind from birth. Some lose their sight afterwards. Accidents and eye disease can happen to anyone.</p>
									
								<p>Some are not completely blind, but are 'legally' blind, which means they have partial use of their sight. Can still see shapes and forms, but perhaps not well enough to drive without glasses.</p>

								<p>Some of these legally blind users could also have different visual impairments like tunnel vision, where they can only see through a tiny gap, as if someone blocked parts of their eyes.</p>
							</li>

							<li>
								<p><span aria-hidden="true">[Next]</span>

								Perhaps not as common. But neurodiverse users, which could include people with ADHD, Autism, and other cognitively diverse attributes, also use screen reader to help consume information.</p>

								<p>If you're wondering how... Have you ever been read to, or joined reading class at school? There's benefit in providing multiple ways to consume the same information. Especially when learning.</p>
							</li>

							<li>
								<p><span aria-hidden="true">[Next]</span>
								AI assistant users are pretty much general high tech population.</p>
								
								<p>This may come as a surprise to you, but tools like Alexa, Siri, Google home essentially functions as screen reader when you ask it to look things up and read out to you. It's reading information from an app or a website to users.</p>
							</li>
					</ol>

					<p>Classic curb cut case, where benefits of designing for access needs like completely blind users also extend to other user groups.</p>

					<p>Introducing OSX/Mac's VoiceOver</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Ok, enough Accessibility basics. Lets take a look at a screen reader</p>

						<p>Because I'm a Mac user, I'm more familiar with Mac's pre-built screen reader called VoiceOver.</p>

					<p>
						<em><strong>screen reader</strong></em> and<br>
						<em><strong>keyboard</strong></em> only navigation can be fun!
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>This, isn't really a session to teach you how to use a screen reader. There are better Youtube videos for that.</p>
						<p>I'm here to show you, that it is just a tool. Another way to ensure that your product is of high quality, that will be usable for your users.</p>
						<p>There's no need to be scared of it. And it is a skill that could come mighty handy in your old age. Easier to learn it now than later</p>
						<p>You get warm and fuzzy feeling that you're doing the right thing, by making it possible for more people to use your product.</p>
