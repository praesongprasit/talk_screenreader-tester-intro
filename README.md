# Talk title

This 25 mins talk was prepared for:
- [NZ Testing Conference](https://www.nztestingconf.co.nz/) - 1st July 2022

Accessibility is finally a hot thing in tech! (Albeit, after years of neglect and many high profile lawsuits later... cheers Dominos)

One of the tools that help users with different access needs use software, is called a screen reader. But how does one use this assistive technology?

Let's run OSX VoiceOver over a site or an app to find out.
